## Add an experiment üß™

You can easily add new TresJS examples into the playground by creating a branch from `main` with the following structure `feature/name-of-your-demo`.

This playground uses [nuxt/content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/)

### Add yourself as an author

First, add yourself as an author so your name figures on the demos you create

![Authoring experiments](public/author.png)

1. Create a `your-name.md` file under `content/authors` directory.
2. Add [Frontmatter](https://content.nuxtjs.org/guide/writing/markdown#front-matter) to provide your meta-data

```md
---
name: Alvaro Saburido
slug: alvarosabu
email: hola@alvarosaburido.dev
twitter: alvarosabu
github: alvarosabu
website: https://alvarosaburido.dev
avatar: https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4699008?s=96&v=4
---
```

### Add a demo

Every demo or experiment consist on two parts

- A markdown file under `content/experiments/`
- A vue component containing the scene under `components/content`

1. Create a `your-awesome-demo.md` file under `content/experiments` directory.
2. Add [Frontmatter](https://content.nuxtjs.org/guide/writing/markdown#front-matter) to provide the meta-data of your experiment, this is crucial to get the cards on the home page nice and pretty. Remember to add the `slug` of your `author` to the correspondant field. Be sure to add `status: published`, otherwise the thumbnail won't show up during your tests.

```md
---
thumbnail: /lowpoly-planet.png
title: Low Poly Planet
slug: lowpoly-planet
author: alvarosabu
status: published
description: Low Poly Planet exported from Blender
tags: ['basic', 'cientos', 'useGLTF', 'blender']
---
```

3. Create a component under `components/content` to hold your scene. If your scene contains `async features`, you can create it like this and Nuxt will auto-import it.

```
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ components/content/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lowpoly-planet/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.vue // This will be the `root` cmponent containing the `TresCanvas`
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ model.vue // Component with async operation
```

4. Add it to the file created on steps **1** and .

```md
---
thumbnail: /lowpoly-planet.png
title: Low Poly Planet
slug: lowpoly-planet
author: alvarosabu
status: published
description: Low Poly Planet exported from Blender
tags: ['basic', 'cientos', 'useGLTF', 'blender']
---

<LowpolyPlanet />
```

5. Take a screenshot of your scene ot the `public` directory.
