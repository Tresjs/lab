This experiment demonstrates **realistic glass and plastic rendering** using Three.js's advanced `MeshPhysicalMaterial`. Explore the properties of transparent materials with real-time controls for transmission, thickness, roughness, and environmental reflections.

### What You'll See

An interactive material showcase featuring:

- **High-Resolution Icosahedron**: 10-subdivision sphere showing detailed surface properties
- **HDR Environment Mapping**: Realistic reflections using high dynamic range textures
- **Background Plane**: Textured backdrop visible through the transparent material
- **Real-Time Controls**: Live adjustment of all material properties
- **Professional Lighting**: Directional and ambient lighting for optimal material display

### Technical Implementation

This experiment demonstrates advanced material techniques:

- **MeshPhysicalMaterial**: Industry-standard PBR material with transmission support
- **HDR Environment Maps**: Equirectangular reflection mapping for realistic lighting
- **Normal Mapping**: Surface detail enhancement using normal map textures
- **Transmission Rendering**: Realistic light transmission through transparent materials
- **Clearcoat Effects**: Surface coating simulation for enhanced realism

### Material Parameters

Fully controllable glass properties:

- **Transmission**: 0-1 range controlling material transparency and light transmission
- **Thickness**: Physical thickness affecting refraction and light behavior
- **Roughness**: Surface smoothness from mirror-like (0) to frosted (1)
- **Environment Intensity**: Reflection strength for environmental lighting
- **HDR Toggle**: Switch between HDR and standard environment mapping

### Rendering Features

- **Physically Accurate**: Based on real-world material properties
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient rendering suitable for real-time applications
- **Grid Reference**: Helper grid for depth perception and scale reference
- **Interactive Controls**: Immediate visual feedback for parameter changes

### Visual Design
